## Gameplay Details

- Pressing the `Fire` (`Left Mouse` by default) button shoots one green laser beam.
- If `Fire` is held down, three consecutive beams will be shot, then a "charge" shot will be charged.
- Charge shots will lock to an enemy and releasing the `Fire` button will release the shot.
- "Bombs" may also be fired if the player has any; these are collected during gameplay.
- The laser beam may also be improved by a power up.
- Collecting a laser power-up will increase the amount of shots to two simultaneous shots.
- Collecting a second laser power-up will fire two simultaneous shots, but more powerful blue ones.

- The player may accelerate (referred to as "boost") or brake to change speed for a short time, however, the player cannot stop moving forward.
- The player may also perform a somersault or a barrel roll.
- Somersaults can be performed by pressing the somersault button, or by moving upwards and braking.
- Barrel rolls can be performed by leaning left or right twice in quick succession.
- In `all range` mode (referred to as `360Â°`), the player may also perform a U-turn by pressing the U-turn button (`F` by default.).
- Boosting, braking, somersaults and U-turns all deplete the `Energy Meter`.
- If the meter turns completely red, these techniques cannot be performed until the meter resets.
- The energy meter replenishes automatically after a short time.

- The player's health is indicated in the "Shield Gauge" in the top left corner of the screen.
- When fighting a boss, the boss's "Shield Gauge" may be displayed vertically on the left side of the screen.
- The player may also take damage to their ship.
- If the player takes a lot of damage at once, there is a chance their ship will lose a wing.
- This affects the control of the ship and reverts any laser power-ups that may have been picked up.
- All wings will be repaired if a Repair or Laser power-up is picked up.
